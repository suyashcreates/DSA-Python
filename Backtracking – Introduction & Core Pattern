## 1️⃣ What is Backtracking (In Simple Words)

### Concept

Backtracking =

> **Try → Explore → Undo → Try another path**

It is **recursion + decision making**.

You:

1. Make a choice
2. Go deeper
3. Undo the choice
4. Try the next option

📌 Used when:

* Multiple answers are possible
* You need **all combinations / paths**

---

## 2️⃣ Difference: Recursion vs Backtracking

| Recursion     | Backtracking     |
| ------------- | ---------------- |
| One path      | Multiple paths   |
| No undo       | Undo required    |
| Linear        | Tree-like        |
| Eg: factorial | Eg: combinations |

💡 Backtracking always forms a **recursive tree**.

## 3️⃣ Core Backtracking Template (VERY IMPORTANT)

Memorize this pattern 👇

```python
def backtrack(state):
    if base_condition:
        answer.append(state.copy())
        return

    for choice in choices:
        make_choice(choice)
        backtrack(state)
        undo_choice(choice)
```

📌 This template repeats in **all** backtracking problems.

## 4️⃣ Example 1: Print All Subsequences

Given: `[1, 2]`

### Code

```python
def subseq(i, arr, temp):
    if i == len(arr):
        print(temp)
        return

    # pick
    temp.append(arr[i])
    subseq(i+1, arr, temp)

    # not pick (undo)
    temp.pop()
    subseq(i+1, arr, temp)

subseq(0, [1,2], [])
```

### Output

```
[1,2]
[1]
[2]
[]
```

🧠 This shows **pick / not pick** decision.

---

## 5️⃣ Undo Step (Most Important Part)

### Why Undo?

Because recursion shares the **same memory reference**.

```python
temp.append(x)   # do
...
temp.pop()       # undo
```

❌ Without undo → wrong answers
✅ Undo keeps paths independent

---

## 6️⃣ Time Complexity of Backtracking

For pick / not pick problems:

* TC → **O(2ⁿ)**
* SC → **O(n)** (recursion stack)

📌 Backtracking is **expensive**, but unavoidable.

---

## 🧪 Practice Problems 

Solve these **using backtracking only**:

1. Print all subsequences of an array
2. Count subsequences with sum = K
3. Print one subsequence with sum = K
