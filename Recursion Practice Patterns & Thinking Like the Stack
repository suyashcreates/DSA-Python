## 1️⃣ How to THINK in Recursion (Most Important Skill)

### Golden Question

For every recursion problem, ask:

> “What does my function assume is already solved?”

You **never** solve the full problem at once.
You solve **n → n-1** and trust the stack.

Example:

```python
def print_n(n):
    if n == 0:
        return
    print_n(n-1)
    print(n)
```

Here you assume:

* `print_n(n-1)` already works

## 2️⃣ Print vs Return in Recursion (Common Confusion)

### Printing Recursion

* Output-based
* No value returned

```python
def print_sum(n, s):
    if n == 0:
        print(s)
        return
    print_sum(n-1, s+n)
```

### Returning Recursion

* Value-based
* Used in calculations

```python
def sum_n(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    return n + sum_n(n-1)
```

📌 **Rule**

* If answer is a value → `return`
* If answer is an action → `print`

## 3️⃣ Order of Execution (Before vs After Call)

### Print BEFORE Recursive Call

```python
def fun(n):
    if n == 0:
        return
    print(n)
    fun(n-1)
```

Output: `n → 1`

### Print AFTER Recursive Call

```python
def fun(n):
    if n == 0:
        return
    fun(n-1)
    print(n)
```

Output: `1 → n`

🧠 This decides **normal vs reverse output**

---

## 4️⃣ Dry Running with Stack Frames (Mandatory Habit)

Example:

```python
fun(3)
```

Stack growth:

```
fun(3)
 fun(2)
  fun(1)
   fun(0)  ← base case
```

Stack unwind:

```
return from fun(1)
return from fun(2)
return from fun(3)
```

📌 **Never code recursion without dry run**

---

## 5️⃣ Recursion Depth & Stack Overflow

### Why Stack Overflow Happens

* Base case missing
* Problem size not reducing
* Too deep recursion (n > 10⁵)

### Example of Dangerous Code ❌

```python
def fun(n):
    fun(n-1)
```

### Safe Thinking

* Every call must move **closer to base case**
* Reduction must be obvious

## 6️⃣ Classic Beginner Recursion Problems (Must Master)

These build intuition, not difficulty.

1. Print name N times
2. Print 1 to N
3. Print N to 1
4. Sum of first N numbers
5. Factorial of N

👉 Solve all **without loops**

## 🧪 Practice Problems for Today (Commit These)

Create one file per problem.

* `print_1_to_n.py`
* `print_n_to_1.py`
* `sum_of_n.py`
* `factorial.py`
* `print_name_n_times.py`

Add **comments explaining stack flow**.

## 🎁 Small but Powerful Tip

If recursion feels confusing:

* Write the **base case first**
* Then write **only one recursive call**
* Trust the stack, don’t fight it
