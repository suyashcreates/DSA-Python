## 1️⃣ Why Binary Search Is More Than “Find an Element”

### Core Insight

Binary Search is not just for arrays.
It works wherever the **answer space is monotonic**.

📌 If:

* answer goes **false → true**
  or
* answer goes **true → false**

→ Binary Search applies.

## 2️⃣ Lower Bound & Upper Bound (Foundational Variant)

### Lower Bound

First index where `arr[i] >= target`

### Upper Bound

First index where `arr[i] > target`

### Code (Lower Bound)

```python
def lower_bound(arr, target):
    low, high = 0, len(arr)
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
    return low
```

📌 This pattern appears everywhere later (STL, problems).

## 3️⃣ Binary Search on Answer (Key Pattern)

### Idea

Instead of searching in array, search in **range of answers**.

Example:

* Minimum speed
* Minimum days
* Maximum capacity

You ask:

> “Is this answer possible?”

---

## 4️⃣ Feasibility Function (Heart of the Pattern)

### Template

```python
def is_possible(mid):
    # check if mid satisfies condition
    return True or False
```

Binary Search controls `mid`,
`is_possible()` validates it.

📌 Separation of concerns is crucial.

## 5️⃣ Binary Search on Answer Template

```python
low, high = min_value, max_value
ans = -1

while low <= high:
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    if is_possible(mid):
        ans = mid
        high = mid - 1   # try better answer
    else:
        low = mid + 1

return ans
```

### Complexity

* **Time → O(log range × check)**

---

## 6️⃣ Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Using binary search without monotonicity
❌ Wrong low / high updates
❌ Infinite loops
❌ Mixing array index BS with answer BS

✅ Always ask:

> “If this works, will bigger/smaller also work?”

## 🧪 Practice Problems (Today)

1. Implement lower bound
2. Implement upper bound
3. Find first occurrence of element
4. Find last occurrence of element

(Only binary search logic, no brute force)
