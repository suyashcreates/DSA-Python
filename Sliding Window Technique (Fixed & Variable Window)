## 1️⃣ What is Sliding Window (Core Idea)

### Concept

A **window** is a subrange `[l … r]` that moves over data.

Instead of recalculating everything:

* You **reuse previous work**
* Add one element
* Remove one element

📌 Used for **subarray / substring** problems.

## 2️⃣ Why Sliding Window Exists (Optimization Logic)

### Brute Force

* Check all subarrays
* Time → **O(n²)**

### Sliding Window

* Each element added once
* Each element removed once

⏱️ Time → **O(n)**

📌 This is a massive improvement.

## 3️⃣ Fixed Size Sliding Window

### When to Use

* Window size `k` is **given**

### Template

```python
window_sum = sum(arr[:k])

for i in range(k, n):
    window_sum += arr[i]      # add new
    window_sum -= arr[i-k]    # remove old
```

📌 Window size never changes.

---

## 4️⃣ Variable Size Sliding Window

### When to Use

* Condition based window size
* Example: sum ≤ k, distinct count, etc.

### Template

```python
l = 0
for r in range(n):
    add(arr[r])

    while condition_invalid:
        remove(arr[l])
        l += 1
```

📌 Window **expands and shrinks dynamically**.

---

## 5️⃣ Relationship: Two Pointers vs Sliding Window

| Two Pointers  | Sliding Window      |
| ------------- | ------------------- |
| Generic       | Specialized         |
| Any movement  | Structured movement |
| Pair problems | Subarray problems   |

📌 Sliding window is **disciplined two pointers**.

---

## 6️⃣ Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Resetting window every time
❌ Nested loops
❌ Forgetting to remove left element
❌ Using extra space unnecessarily

✅ Each element must:

* enter window once
* leave window once

---

## 🧪 Practice Problems 

Solve using **sliding window only**:

1. Maximum sum of subarray of size `k`
2. First negative number in every window of size `k` (logic only)
3. Count subarrays with sum ≤ k (conceptual)

Add comments explaining:

* window movement
* why O(n)
