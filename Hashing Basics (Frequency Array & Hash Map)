## 1️⃣ What is Hashing (Simple Meaning)

### Core Idea

Hashing lets you:

* **store**
* **search**
* **count**

in **O(1)** average time.

Instead of scanning the array again and again:
👉 store info once and reuse.

## 2️⃣ Frequency Counting (Most Common Use)

### Problem Pattern

“How many times does X appear?”

### Brute Force

* Scan whole array each time
* ⏱️ O(n²)

### Hashing

* Count once
* ⏱️ O(n)

---

## 3️⃣ Frequency Array (When Range is Small)

### Example

```python
arr = [1, 3, 2, 1, 3]
freq = [0] * 6

for x in arr:
    freq[x] += 1
```

📌 Use when:

* Values are small
* Continuous range

---

## 4️⃣ Hash Map / Dictionary (General Case)

### Example

```python
freq = {}

for x in arr:
    freq[x] = freq.get(x, 0) + 1
```

Operations:

* Insert → O(1)
* Search → O(1)
* Update → O(1)

📌 This is used **everywhere** in DSA.

## 5️⃣ Where Hashing is Used (Important)

Hashing appears in:

* Duplicate detection
* Pair sum problems
* Subarray problems (later)
* String frequency
* Prefix sum optimizations

📌 You will see this **daily** later.

## 6️⃣ Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Using array when range is large
❌ Forgetting default value
❌ Modifying hash while iterating
❌ Thinking hashing is sorted (it is not)

✅ Hashing is about **speed**, not order.

---

## 🧪 Practice Problems

Do only using hashing:

1. Count frequency of elements
2. Find element with maximum frequency
3. Check if array contains duplicates
4. Find first non-repeating element (logic)
