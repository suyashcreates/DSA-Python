## 1️⃣ What is an Anagram (In DSA Terms)

Two strings are anagrams if:

* same characters
* same frequencies
* order does **not** matter

Example:

```
"listen"  ↔  "silent"
```

---

## 2️⃣ Brute Force Thinking (What NOT to Do)

* Sort both strings
* Compare
* ⏱️ O(n log n)

Works, but **not optimal**.

---

## 3️⃣ Optimal Insight (Frequency is the Truth)

If:

* both strings have **identical frequency arrays**

👉 they are anagrams.

---

## 4️⃣ Anagram Check Using Array Hashing

(Assume lowercase a–z)

```python
def is_anagram(s, t):
    if len(s) != len(t):
        return False

    freq = [0] * 26

    for ch in s:
        freq[ord(ch) - ord('a')] += 1

    for ch in t:
        freq[ord(ch) - ord('a')] -= 1

    for x in freq:
        if x != 0:
            return False

    return True
```

⏱️ Time: O(n)
📦 Space: O(1)

---

## 5️⃣ Important Observation (Interview Gold)

You:

* **increment** for first string
* **decrement** for second string

If everything cancels to zero → perfect match.

This **increment–decrement pattern** appears later in:

* sliding window
* substring problems

## 6️⃣ Related String Comparison Problems

Once you know this, you can solve:

* Check if two strings are permutations
* Compare strings ignoring order
* Validate rearrangements

All same **core logic**.

## 🧪 Practice Problems 

1. Check if two strings are anagrams
2. Check if two strings are permutations
3. Check if two strings have same character set
4. Count minimum deletions to make two strings anagrams (logic only)
