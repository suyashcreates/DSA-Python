* Why does Insertion Sort work?
* Best case time complexity?
* Worst case?
* Why is it adaptive?

Then dry run manually on:

```
[9, 5, 1, 4, 3]
```

Write each step in comments inside your file.

## 💻 2️⃣ Code Task (Core)

### Task A:

Implement:

```python
def insertion_sort(arr):
```

No shortcuts. No built-ins.

### Task B:

Modify it so it:

* Counts number of comparisons
* Counts number of swaps
* Returns both

This builds awareness of cost. That’s how engineers think.

## 🔍 3️⃣ Deep Understanding Drill

After coding, answer in README:

* Why do we shift instead of swap repeatedly?
* When is Insertion Sort better than Bubble Sort?
* Where is it used in real systems?

Hint: small arrays + nearly sorted data.

---

## 🧪 4️⃣ Edge Case Testing

Test with:

* Already sorted array
* Reverse sorted array
* All elements same
* Single element
* Empty list

Engineers test edges. Students don’t.
