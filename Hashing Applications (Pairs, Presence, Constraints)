## 1️⃣ Core Pattern You Are Learning Today

Many problems secretly mean:

> “Can I remember what I’ve already seen?”

Hashing turns:

* repeated scanning ❌
* into instant lookup ✅

---

## 2️⃣ Classic Problem Type 1: Pair Exists (Two Sum Logic)

### Problem Statement

Given array `arr` and number `k`
👉 check if **any pair** sums to `k`

---

### Brute Force

```text
Check all pairs
O(n²)
```

---

### Hashing Insight

While traversing:

* current element = `x`
* needed = `k - x`
* check if needed exists in hash

---

### Code

```python
def pair_exists(arr, k):
    seen = set()
    for x in arr:
        if k - x in seen:
            return True
        seen.add(x)
    return False
```

⏱️ Time: O(n)
📦 Space: O(n)

---

## 3️⃣ Why This Works (Important Thinking)

You are **splitting the pair across time**:

* one element seen earlier
* one element seen now

This is a **recurring DSA trick**.

---

## 4️⃣ Classic Problem Type 2: Count Pairs

Instead of just checking existence:
👉 count number of valid pairs

### Key Rule

* Use frequency map
* Be careful of duplicates

---

### Example Logic

```python
freq = {}
count = 0

for x in arr:
    if k - x in freq:
        count += freq[k - x]
    freq[x] = freq.get(x, 0) + 1
```

---

## 5️⃣ Problem Type 3: Missing / Presence Queries

Example:

* “Is X present?”
* “How many queries?”

Hashing turns:

* repeated searching → O(1)

📌 Used heavily in competitive programming.

## 6️⃣ Mistakes Beginners Make

❌ Sorting when hashing is enough
❌ Forgetting duplicate handling
❌ Using list instead of set/map
❌ Overthinking when lookup is needed

---

## 🧪 Practice Problems (Do All)

1. Check if pair with sum `k` exists
2. Count pairs with sum `k`
3. Check if array elements are unique
4. Find element appearing more than once
