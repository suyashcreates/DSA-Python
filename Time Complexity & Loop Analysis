Learn to **think in growth rates**, quickly **analyze loops**, and **optimize naive solutions**. By the end, you should confidently say the **TC (and why)** for most beginner problems.

## 1️⃣ What Time Complexity Really Means

### Core Idea

Time Complexity is **not the time taken**, but the **rate at which operations grow** with input size `n`.

* Independent of machine
* Focuses on scalability
* Measured in terms of primitive operations

📌 Interview phrase to remember:

> “We analyze how the algorithm scales as input increases.”

## 2️⃣ Big-O, Theta, Omega (Clean Mental Model)

### Big-O → Upper Bound (Worst Case)

* Maximum work algorithm can do
* Used most in interviews

### Theta → Tight/Average Bound

* Typical behavior

### Omega → Lower Bound (Best Case)

* Minimum possible work

⚠️ In practice: **use Big-O unless asked otherwise**.

## 3️⃣ Rules You MUST Apply 

### Rule 1: Ignore Constants

```python
for i in range(5*n):   # O(n)
    pass
```

### Rule 2: Ignore Lower Order Terms

```python
O(n^2 + n + 10) → O(n^2)
```

### Rule 3: Sequential Blocks Add

```python
O(n) + O(n) = O(n)
```

### Rule 4: Nested Blocks Multiply

```python
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
        pass
# O(n^2)
```

---

## 4️⃣ Loop Analysis Techniques (Very Important)

### Technique 1: Count Rows & Columns

* Outer loop → rows
* Inner loop → columns

Total operations = rows × columns

---

### Technique 2: Variable Loop Bounds

```python
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i):
        pass
```

Operations:

```
1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n(n+1)/2
```

👉 **O(n²)**

---

### Technique 3: Changing Loop Direction

```python
for i in range(n, 0, -1):
    pass
```

Still **O(n)** (direction doesn’t matter)

---

## 5️⃣ When Time Complexity is Logarithmic

### Key Signal

* Input size **divides** each iteration

```python
while n > 1:
    n //= 2
```

Iterations ≈ log₂(n)

👉 **O(log n)**

---

## 6️⃣ Competitive Programming Rule 

* ~10⁸ operations ≈ 1 second

| Complexity | Max n (approx) |
| ---------- | -------------- |
| O(n)       | 10⁸            |
| O(n log n) | 10⁷            |
| O(n²)      | 10⁴            |
| O(n³)      | 500            |

Use this to **reject slow solutions early**.

---

## 🧪 Practice Problems 

### Problem 1: TC of Nested Loop

```python
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i):
        print(i, j)
```

Explain using summation.

---

### Problem 2: Optimize Double Loop

Naive:

```python
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
        if arr[i] == arr[j]:
            count += 1
```

Optimize to **O(n)** using a dictionary.

---

### Problem 3: Identify Logarithmic Loop

```python
x = n
while x > 0:
    x //= 3
```

Find TC and explain.

---

### Problem 4: Pattern Printing TC

Analyze TC for pattern programs where print is inside inner loop.

---

## 🎁 Bonus (Exam + Interview Edge)

* Printing counts as O(1) per print
* Direction of loop doesn’t change TC
* Focus on **what shrinks or grows**
* Most optimizations come from removing nested loops
