## 1️⃣ What is the Two Pointer Technique

### Concept

Use **two indices** to process data instead of nested loops.

Instead of:

* fixing one index and scanning again ❌

You:

* move pointers smartly to reduce work ✅

📌 Goal: **reduce time complexity**

---

## 2️⃣ Why Two Pointers Exist (Motivation)

### Brute Force

```text
for i:
  for j:
```

⏱️ O(n²)

### Two Pointers

```text
i →     ← j
```

⏱️ O(n)

📌 This technique replaces many double loops.

---

## 3️⃣ Basic Two Pointer Pattern (Opposite Ends)

### Typical Use

* Sorted data
* Pair / condition based problems

### Template

```python
l, r = 0, n-1

while l < r:
    if condition:
        l += 1
    else:
        r -= 1
```

📌 Only **one pointer moves per step**.

---

## 4️⃣ Same Direction Two Pointers

### Pattern

Both pointers move forward, but at different speeds.

```python
slow = 0
for fast in range(n):
    if valid:
        arr[slow] = arr[fast]
        slow += 1
```

📌 Used in:

* Removing duplicates
* Filtering elements
* In-place modifications

---

## 5️⃣ How to Decide Pointer Movement

Ask:

> “If condition is true, which side should shrink?”

Example logic:

* Sum too big → move right pointer left
* Sum too small → move left pointer right

📌 Movement is driven by **monotonic behavior**.

---

## 6️⃣ Time & Space Complexity

* **Time** → O(n)
* **Space** → O(1)

📌 This is why interviewers love this technique.

---

## 🧪 Practice Problems (Today)

Solve using **two pointers only**:

1. Check if a pair exists with given sum (sorted data)
2. Reverse a sequence using two pointers
3. Remove duplicates logic (conceptual, no library)
