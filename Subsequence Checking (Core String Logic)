## 1️⃣ What is a Subsequence (Clear Definition)

A string **s** is a subsequence of **t** if:

* characters appear in the **same order**
* but **not necessarily contiguous**

Example:

```
s = "ace"
t = "abcde"
→ true
```

❌ Order change is NOT allowed.

---

## 2️⃣ Why This Topic Matters

Subsequence logic appears in:

* string filtering
* pattern matching
* DP problems later
* interview warm-up questions

This is a **thinking problem**, not syntax.

---

## 3️⃣ Brute Force Thinking (Wrong Way)

* Generate all subsequences
* Compare

🚫 Exponential
🚫 Completely unnecessary

---

## 4️⃣ Optimal Insight: Two Pointers

Use:

* `i` → pointer for subsequence
* `j` → pointer for main string

Move forward only.

---

## 5️⃣ Subsequence Check Code

```python
def is_subsequence(s, t):
    i = 0

    for ch in t:
        if i < len(s) and s[i] == ch:
            i += 1

    return i == len(s)
```

⏱️ Time: O(n)
📦 Space: O(1)

---

## 6️⃣ Key Observations (Important)

* You **never move backwards**
* You **only care about order**
* Skipping is allowed
* Matching consumes characters

This logic appears later in:

* string DP
* greedy problems

---

## 🧪 Practice Problems 

1. Check if string `s` is subsequence of `t`
2. Check if one string is subsequence of another
3. Count how many characters of `s` appear in order in `t`
4. Explain why subsequence ≠ substring (README)
